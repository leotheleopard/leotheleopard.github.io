<h1>Hello!</h1>

<h3>This here is a live chart of my gaining progress for the last decade of my life that I have been recording my weight. Some information may be inaccurate since it's old and I didn't remember exact numbers, but I've tried to keep it pretty close!</h3>

<h1>Gaining FAQ!</h1>
<h3>How old were you when you started gaining?</h3>
<p>I was 16 when I decided to get fat for the first time in my life. On the chart above thats 2018.
<hr>
<h3>Why does the chart start in 2016 then?</h3>
<p>That's was the first day I ever knew I wanted to be fat. My 14th birthday, I stood on a Wii Balance Board that called me overweight for being 90kg (tall kid, not particularly fat kid) and I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment in being called overweight, and it felt really good, so I went after that!</p>
<hr>
<h3>Have any photos from back then?</h3>
<p>No. That's incredibly gross and creepy. What thr fuck.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Do you have a goal weight?</h3>
<p>I have no long term goal weight, I just like being fat and getting fatter. in the shorter term, sure, I'd love to be 500lbs before my 25th birthday, but for the long term, nothing planned.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Any plans for immobility? Being bedbound?</h3>
<p>Again, No plans here. If it happens, sure, I'll take it in stride, but its a lot of work and just in the plans right now.</p>
