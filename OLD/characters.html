                <p><B>Where did he come from?</b> <br>
                Leo was born in a facility, dubbed #47, he didn't have much of a life, but was always rewarded. He was biologically engineered to be more human than leopard but lacked some certain life skills, like using the bathroom. He's always been a fan of his food and it was used as a way to get him to obey, making him the size he is now. He has since been released from the facility and moved into the nearest city, Cape Weight, but he doens't think he'll learn to use the bathroom any time soon and those Heart Stopper burgers just taste so good.</p>

                <p><b>Where Did He Come From?</b><br>
                Damien was born and raised in Cape Weight, since he could remember he's never been cleaned and never taught how to use the bathroom and he loves it that way. He lives for being fiilthy and has never wanted it another way. He knows he pushes people away with his filth, even in the city of Cape Weight, but that gets him turned on even more. He is a sexual deviant to the highest degree and takes no hesitation in relieving himself wherever he is.</p>
