        <p><b>What's your name?</b><br>
            Leo. That's all you get. That's the name I go my online, that's the name you're getting.<br><br>
            <b>Where do you live?</b><br>
            New Zealand! <br><br>
            <b>How Old Are You?</b><br>
            Bro that's kinda creepy! I'm 18.<br><br>
            <b>Are you gay?</b><br>
            Very. So VERY gay. Like... violently gay. RAWR YASS QUEEN WERK<br><br>
            <b>Why do you write?</b><br>
            To get shit out of my system. I write to vent. Sometimes that writing is angry song lyrics (hidden and never to be seen) or that writing is horny and cum worthy so I jot it down and keep it for later.<br><br>
            <b>Yeah, but why a WEBSITE for the stuff you write?</b><br>
            Why not? I had the tools to make a website. I wanted a cool kind of tie in with them and somewhere people can go to find information if they're confused as fuck.<br><br>
            <b>Do you take donations?</b><br>
            I allow people to donate to me. Taking donations is theft because someone ELSE worked for those donations. Contact me if you want to donate though!<br><br>
