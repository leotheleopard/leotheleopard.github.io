            <p>Cape Weight is a medical and Technological marvel. The city and suburbs of Cape Weight are all made to make life easier. Homelessness isn't a problem, hunger isn't a problem. The whole area is built on Weight. The more you weigh, the more power you have. Everyone has equal opportunities to advance, if they just eat more.

            <h2>The Leaderboard</h2>
            <p>The Leaderboard is the most important place in the city. since everyone is assigned an ID at birth, this board tracks their weight and how big they are compared to everyone else in the city. The city's many citizens are all able to see who is at the top and all aim to get there themselves. Right at the top of the board was the mayor of our small town, Jeremy Maidenson, the son of Craig and his sister Amy, sitting pretty at 1043lbs, at least 150lbs above anyone else. The Mayor's Position has always been given to heaviest Citizen.</p>

            <h2>The City Center</h2>
            <p>The City Center is the biggest part of Cape Weight. It holds all the political offices and emergency services, although crime is at an all time low, health is still an important part of everyone's lives.

            <hr>
            <h2>The City Law Center</h2>
            <p>This building isn't used for much, it was the court house, which wasn't very helpful since the city has no crime, however it now stores all of the city's law documents, including the document stating the reason for founding such a city.

            <h2>Area01 - Family Sub-City - Intestia</h2>
            <p>Family is important for everyone, most families in this area live a small life and keep to themselves, for any needs. Family sex is a common theme, and most families who live in this area like keeping the kids in the family. It's not uncommon to hear of a mother being impregnated by her son or a father getting his daughter pregnant, or even just brothers and sisters having fun together. Due to the medical magic at the Cape Weight Hospital, inbreeding problems don't exist, so large families with plenty of incestuous kids are common, so are gatherings for lewd activities between families.</p>

            <h2>Area02 - Slob Sub-City - Grocity</h2>
            <p>Every city has it's sewers, this city IS the sewers. The place is covered in and surrounded by trash and filth. Nothing is held back here, and most residents of the area don't use toilets or anything to keep hygiene in check. They will happily do their business on the ground. This is also where the city wide hygeine management system is sorted, most citizens of this area work in the sewage plant and a few of them are the sewage "cleaners", although the name is a bit more glamourous than it might seem, it is a highly valued position in the city.</p>

            <h2>The Student Station</h2>
            <p>Students make up a large part of the city population, and they need places to study. That's what the Station is for, it takes students and sends them to the perfect place for them to learn, with as many subjects as they can think of to get the perfect education for who they are and who they want to be.</p>
